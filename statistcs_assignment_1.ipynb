        "Qualitative data, also known as the categorical data, describes the data that fits into the categories. Qualitative data are not numerical. The categorical information involves categorical variables that describe the features such as a person’s gender, home town etc. Categorical measures are defined in terms of natural language specifications, but not in terms of numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of the categorical data are birthdate, favourite sport, school postcode.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantitative or Numerical Data\n",
        "Quantitative data is also known as numerical data which represents the numerical value (i.e., how much, how often, how many). Numerical data gives information about the quantities of a specific thing. Some examples of numerical data are height, length, size, weight, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Nominal Data\n",
        "Nominal data is one of the types of qualitative information which helps to label the variables without providing the numerical value. Nominal data is also called the nominal scale. It cannot be ordered and measured.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinal Data\n",
        "Ordinal data/variable is a type of data that follows a natural order. The significant feature of the nominal data is that the difference between the data values is not determined. This variable is mostly found in surveys, finance, economics, questionnaires, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interval Scales\n",
        "The interval scale is the 3rd level of measurement scale. It is defined as a quantitative measurement scale in which the difference between the two variables is meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ratio Scale\n",
        "The ratio scale is the 4th level of measurement scale, which is quantitative. It is a type of variable measurement scale. It allows researchers to compare the differences or intervals.\n",

        "Ans 2. The central tendency of the dataset can be found out using the three important measures namely mean, median and mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "mean\n",
        "The mean represents the average value of the dataset. It can be calculated as the sum of all the values in the dataset divided by the number of values. In general, it is considered as the arithmetic mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is observed that if all the values in the dataset are the same, then all geometric, arithmetic and harmonic mean values are the same. If there is variability in the data, then the mean value differs. Calculating the mean value is completely easy. The formula to calculate the mean value is given by\n",

        "\n",
        "median\n",
        "Median is the middle value of the dataset in which the dataset is arranged in the ascending order or in descending order. When the dataset contains an even number of values, then the median value of the dataset can be found by taking the mean of the middle two values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mode\n",
        "The mode represents the frequently occurring value in the dataset. Sometimes the dataset may contain multiple modes and in some cases, it does not contain any mode at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 3. Dispersion\n",
        "\n",
        "Dispersion in statistics refers to the spread or variability of data points within a dataset, and its measures, like range, standard deviation, mean deviation, and interquartile range (IQR), quantify how spread out the data is from its central tendency (mean or median) allowing for comparison between different datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variance\n",
        "\n",
        "According to layman’s words, the variance is a measure of how far a set of data are dispersed out from their mean or average value. It is denoted as ‘σ2’.\n",
        "\n",
        "Properties of Variance\n",
        "It is always non-negative since each term in the variance sum is squared and therefore the result is either positive or zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Variance always has squared units. For example, the variance of a set of weights estimated in kilograms will be given in kg squared. Since the population variance is squared, we cannot compare it directly with the mean or the data themselves.\n",

        "\n",
        "Standard Deviation\n",
        "\n",
        "The spread of statistical data is measured by the standard deviation. Distribution measures the deviation of data from its mean or average position. The degree of dispersion is computed by the method of estimating the deviation of data points. It is denoted by the symbol, ‘σ’.\n",

        "Properties of Standard Deviation\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "When the data values of a group are similar, then the standard deviation will be very low or close to zero. But when the data values vary with each other, then the standard variation is high or far from zero.\n",

        "Ans 4.\n",
        "box plot\n",
        "\n",
        "A box plot (aka box and whisker plot) uses boxes and lines to depict the distributions of one or more groups of numeric data. Box limits indicate the range of the central 50% of the data, with a central line marking the median value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The box plot distribution will explain how tightly the data is grouped, how the data is skewed, and also about the symmetry of data. Positively Skewed: If the distance from the median to the maximum is greater than the distance from the median to the minimum, then the box plot is positively skewed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 5. Random sampling plays a crucial role in making inferences about populations by ensuring that a selected sample is representative of the larger population, allowing researchers to draw reliable conclusions about the population characteristics based on the data collected from that sample, as every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, minimizing bias and increasing the validity of the inferences made.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 6. Skewness measures the deviation of a random variable's given distribution from the normal distribution, which is symmetrical on both sides.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Skewness\n",
        "There are three main types of skewness:\n",
        "\n",
        "Positive Skewness (Right Skewness):\n",
        "In a positively skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution extends towards the right.\n",
        "\n",
        "The majority of the data points are concentrated on the left side of the distribution, while the right tail is longer.\n",
        "The mean is typically greater than the median, and the mode is usually less than the median.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s also known as right skewness because the longer tail is on the right side when the distribution is represented graphically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Negative Skewness (Left Skewness):\n",
        "\n",
        "In a negatively skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution extends towards the left.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of the data points are concentrated on the right side of the distribution, while the left tail is longer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean is typically less than the median, and the mode is usually greater than the median.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s called left skewness because the longer tail is on the left side when graphed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Zero Skewness:\n",
        "A distribution is considered to have zero skewness when it is perfectly symmetrical.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a symmetric distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "There’s an equal probability of values occurring on either side of the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Skewness significantly impacts data interpretation by revealing the asymmetry in a distribution, meaning that if data is skewed, the mean may not accurately represent the central tendency due to the presence of extreme values on one side of the distribution, potentially leading to misleading conclusions if not properly considered during analysis; this is especially important when comparing the mean, median, and mode of a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans 7.Interquartile Range Definition\n",
        "The interquartile range defines the difference between the third and the first quartile. Quartiles are the partitioned values that divide the whole series into 4 equal parts. So, there are 3 quartiles. First Quartile is denoted by Q1 known as the lower quartile, the second Quartile is denoted by Q2 and the third Quartile is denoted by Q3 known as the upper quartile. Therefore, the interquartile range is equal to the upper quartile minus lower quartile.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interquartile Range Formula\n",
        "The difference between the upper and lower quartile is known as the interquartile range. The formula for the interquartile range is given below\n",
        "\n",
        "Interquartile Range = Upper Quartile - Lower Quartile = Q3-Q1\n",

        "Ans 9. The binomial distribution has several properties, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Fixed number of trials: There is a set number of trials, or repetitions of an experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Two possible outcomes: Each trial has only two possible outcomes, such as success or failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Independent trials: The trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Constant probability of success: The probability of success or failure remains constant for each trial.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Discrete distribution: The binomial distribution is discrete, meaning it has a finite amount of events.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Key parameter: p: The probability of success, denoted as p, is a key parameter in binomial distribution. It represents the likelihood that a single trial will result in a success.\n",

        "Properties of  the empirical rule:\n",
        "1. 68% within 1 standard deviation:\n",
        "This means that roughly 68% of data points will lie between the mean minus one standard deviation and the mean plus one standard deviation.\n",

        "A real-life example of a Poisson process is the number of phone calls received by a customer service center per hour, assuming the calls arrive independently at a constant average rate throughout the hour; let's say the average call rate is 5 calls per hour. To calculate the probability of receiving exactly 2 calls in a given hour, use the Poisson distribution formula with λ (average rate) = 5 and k (desired number of calls) = 2: P(X=2) = (e^-5 * 5^2) / 2! = 0.084, meaning there is an 8.4% chance of receiving exactly 2 calls in that hour.\n",
